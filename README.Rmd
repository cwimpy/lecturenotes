# An modified R Markdown template for writing lecture notes and academic papers

This is a modified, and personalized, template built upon the great template provided by @grantmcdermott [here](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/lecturenotes). Since my efforts are for my own purposes and not super generalized, I suggest you start with the original template. Of course you are free to use mine as wellâ€”you will just need to change some things to suit your needs.
